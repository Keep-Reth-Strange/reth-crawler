## How to build the crawler

`reth-crawler` is not stable now and it's in active development. In order to try it, follow these steps:

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Keep-Reth-Strange/reth-crawler
```

### Run it

Open the directory where it's been installed previously and build it:

```bash
cargo build -p reth-crawler
```

Go to `target/debug` folder:

```bash
cd target/debug
```

Run it:

```bash
./reth-crawler crawl
```

### Run it locally without a centralized db

For local testing there is a flag to save peers in a `peers_data.json` file:

```bash
./reth-crawler crawl --save-to-json
```
